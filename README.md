# giftlist

We would appreciate any of the following:

- Voucher for John Lewis, IKEA, or JoJo Maman Bebe
- Clothes such as stretch suits / babygros, vests, socks, bootees, mittens (to stop from scratching)
  * newborn or bigger sizes
- Muslins
- Bibs
- Books (especially baby ones that are sensory/touch and feel, and books for toddlers that have characters with different skin tones)
- Toys for newborns incl. any animal from the Jellycat toy range 
- Anything else you think newbie parents would find useful!

We do not know the gender yet (and won't find out until they are born!) so any colours are good - we have generally gone with an animal theme thus far.
